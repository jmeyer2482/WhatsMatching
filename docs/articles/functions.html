<p>You can access the documentation for the functions from the navbar
above. There are essentially four functions that carry the package with
the fifth being the shiny app. In this vignette I will briefly go
through the basic data generation and matching process to demonstrate
the functionality of the package.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-generation">Data Generation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-generation"></a>

<p>Let’s create some data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Ok, we’ve loaded the package and used the most simplistic operation
of the <code><a href="../reference/create.sim.data.html">create.sim.data()</a></code> function. This will generate the
plot that you may have seen in the other vignettes for <em>Simulation
1</em>. You will note the inclusion of an additional <code>error</code>
variable in output above. This variable can be ignored generally, it is
the value that is added to <code>y</code> within the function and
represents random error. You can adjust the amount of “error” in the
output by changing the value of the <code>jitter</code> variable (see <a href="reference/create.sim.data.html">documentation</a> for more
details).</p>

<p>Matching using generated data (or any data) is very straight forward

<p>When looking at this plot, I prefer a standardised view. It is much
more useful when comparing Propensity Score Matching with Mahalanobis
Distance Matching. Generally I use the number of standard deviations
from zero. This is because the distance is always a positive number and
the closer it is to zero, the better chance of it improving covariate
balance.</p>

<p>That looks much better. Figure 5 clearly demonstrates that the
comparison between the two methods is much easier on the standardised
plot (b). It’s important to remember that the scale is different between
the Propensity Score and the Mahalanobis Distance. Standardising them
means we can make an easier comparison.</p>

<p>There are several ways this package is set up to estimate treatment
effects. We have access to a number of pre-specified variables for
propensity score methods as well as the data from the matching process.
