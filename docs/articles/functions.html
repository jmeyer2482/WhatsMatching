</h2>
<p>You can access the <a href="reference/index.html">documentation</a>
for the functions from the navbar above. There are essentially four
functions that carry the package with the fifth being the shiny app. In
this vignette I will briefly go through the basic data generation and
matching process to demonstrate the functionality of the package for
advanced users who wish to use the WhatsMatching functionality outside
of the app.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-generation">Data Generation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-generation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s create some data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="co">#load the package</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 2 0    Control -1.389  1.383  0.045 0.051</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 6 0    Control  0.955 -0.676  0.617 0.338</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, we’ve loaded the package and used the most simplistic operation
of the <code><a href="../reference/create.sim.data.html">create.sim.data()</a></code> function to simulate some random
data. This will generate the plot that you may have seen in the other
vignettes for <em>Simulation 1</em>. You will note the inclusion of an
additional <code>error</code> variable in the output above. This
variable can be ignored generally, it is the value that is added to
<code>y</code> within the function and represents random error. You can
adjust the amount of “error” in the output by changing the value of the
<code>jitter</code> variable (see <a href="reference/create.sim.data.html">documentation</a> for more
details).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="matching">Matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matching"></a>
</h3>
<p>Matching using generated data (or any data) is achieved using the
<code><a href="../reference/matched.data.html">matched.data()</a></code> function. You’ll see I’ve specified an
interaction term on <code>X2</code>, this is purely for illustrative
purposes.</p>

<p>When looking at this plot, I prefer a standardised view. It is much
more useful when comparing Propensity Score Matching with Mahalanobis
Distance Matching. Generally I use the number of standard deviations
from zero. This is because the distance is always a positive number and
the closer it is to zero, the better chance of it improving covariate
balance.</p>

<p>That looks much better. Figure 5 clearly demonstrates that the
comparison between the two methods is much easier on the standardised
plot (b). It’s important to remember that the scale is different between
the Propensity Score and the Mahalanobis Distance. Standardising them
means we can make an easier comparison.</p>

<p>There are several ways this package is set up to estimate treatment
effects. We have access to a number of pre-specified variables for
propensity score methods as well as the data from the matching process.
