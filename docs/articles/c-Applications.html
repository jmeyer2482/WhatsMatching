</h2>
<p>This example uses one of the simulations from King and Neilsen’s 2019
paper. It takes three groups representing a fully blocked experiment, a
random experiment and a group of all controls. Covariates X1 and X2 are
generated with the fully blocked experiment being almost identically
paired between treated and control units and the random experiment group
has, as you would guess, randomly placed treated and control units. The
control group consists of only control units and no treated units.</p>
<p>The methods being compared in this example are the use of the
Mahalanobis distance, which is calculated using the distance between a
treated and control unit in the context of the covariance matrix, and
the Propensity Score, which is essentially logistic regression on the
treatment variable using selected covariates. The outcome demonstrated
is that, under these conditions, the Mahalanobis distance is superior to
the Propensity score in selecting the fully blocked experiment first.
This occurs because the Propensity score, once calculated, is blind to
the real data that informs the probability of treatment.<br>
Settings: Data from Simulation 1<br>
Method 1 - Mahalanobis ordered by data without replacement Method 2 -
Propensity score ordered by data without replacement Matched on
<code>X1</code> and <code>X2</code> Treatment effect calculated using
<code>y ~ t</code></p>

The propensity score may not be the best choice for achieving covariate
balance, which is a primary aim of matching.</p>

</h2>
<p>We demonstrate in Fig. 3. that the intuitiveness behind using
replacement may not be clear. This simulation is also from the King ans
Neilsen paper. <code>X1</code> and <code>X2</code> constitute 2
overlapping uniform distributions for the treated and control groups.
There are 200 units in the dataset with 100 units in each group. For
this simulation we have only changed whether the matches are conducted
with replacement.</p>
<p>You can clearly see that there are a number of the control units that
are unmatched. This has occurred because there are other “closer”
controls who can be matched to the treated units. If we look at <em>Plot
3</em> in the panel we can see that the covariate balance has been
maintained and, as we expect, the estimate treatment effect approaches
the true effect.</p>

<p>Take home message:<br>
Datasets where the treated and control groups are approximately equal
may require the consideration of different settings to achieve covariate
balance and thus a more accurate estimate of the treatment effect.</p>

</h2>
<p>For this example we are using the same simulation as in Fig. 2. This
time we are comparing the ordering of the matches. In this case
comparison is starting with the smallest propensity score versus
starting with the largest. This essentially boils down to matching the
treated units with the lowest probability of being treated first or
starting with those with the highest probability of being treated.</p>
<p>We can see below in Fig. 4. that <em>Plot 1</em> has made some
unusual pairings. This makes some sense as when you pair units that have
the highest probability of being treated first then you quickly increase
the distances between the remaining units that need to be paired. This
means that the “good matches” are getting further and further away.</p>
<p>This is a problem that can occur for any matching method as most
matching methods use nearest neighbour methodology. If the best nearest
neighbour is already paired then the process just moves to the next
available one no matter the distance. This further highlights the
advantage of using replacement which conveniently ignores ordering and
selects the nearest partner irrespective of if it is matched.</p>

</h2>
<p>Covariate specification and model selection are important when
undertaking matching. Ideally, the matching occurs in such a way that
the model specification is less important (another problem for causal
inference in observational data!) which will remove some of the bias. In
this simulation we have a bivariate normal distribution that has been
adjusted based on the user selections. The data generation here allows
users to select the treatment effect and how <code>X1</code> and
<code>X2</code> fit into the data from a causal aspect. In this case,
<code>X1</code> is a confounder between <code>t</code> and
<code>y</code>, and <code>X2</code> is a mediator between <code>t</code>
and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>There are a few things to unpick here. Firstly, we have only matched
on the confounding variable, <code>X1</code>, and we have included in
the model for the estimate. Interestingly, there is little difference
between the the 2 methods for matching, and therefore the covarate
balance and estimates are very similar. We can tell the pairing is
baised to <code>X1</code> because the lines the demonstrate the pairs
are vertical. That tells us the shortest distance between the units is
horizontal (aka the x-axis or <code>X1</code>).</p>
