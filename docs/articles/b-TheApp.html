</h2>
<p>This project has been developed as a Shiny app using the Golem
framework to support it’s production. There are a number of key
functions that have been implemented to generate the data and matching
processes. Let’s have a look in a bit more detail.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-golem-framework">The golem framework<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-golem-framework"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://golemverse.org/" target="_blank" class="external-link">Golem
framework</a> is the brain child of Colin Fay. In essence, Shiny apps
are ideal for development as a R package. That is to say that, the
package structure lends itself well to the development of production
grade Shiny apps.</p>
<p>The <code>golem</code> package itself provides functions and helpers
to generate and create the framework that can be used for the
development of the Shiny app and package. In addition, there are
<a href="https://engineering-shiny.org/" target="_blank" class="external-link"> theoretical
underpinnings and best practice advice</a> provided to give the best
chance of developing a high quality application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="key-functions-and-functionality">Key functions and functionality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-functions-and-functionality"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are
<a href="https://jmeyer2482.github.io/WhatsMatching/reference/index.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">four
key functions</a> that have been developed as part of the package in
order to make data generation and analysis as straightforward as
possible. They are <code>create.sim.data</code>,
<code>matched.data</code>, <code>matching.plot</code>, and
<code>combined.plot</code>. The functions have been designed to follow
and iterative process.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="create-sim-data">
<code>create.sim.data()</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-sim-data"></a>
</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, this is the data simulation function. There are
four simulations available for use within the app. Each one has a
specific type of data generation to expore the matching process.</p>
<p><em>Simulation 1</em> is based on King and Neilsen’s most simplistic
illustration of finding the hidden experiment in the data.</p>
<p><em>Simulation 2</em> is based on King and Neilsen’s illustration to
show model dependence and bias.</p>
<p><em>Simulation 3</em> is generated based on using 2 covariates with a
normal distribution. The user can change the causal relationships
between the covariates and/or the treatment and outcome variables but
cannot change the strength of the relationships.</p>
<p><em>Simulation 4</em> uses a bivariate normal distribution to
generate data where the user can alter the level of confounding between
the covariates and the treatment and outcome variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="matched-data">
<code>matched.data()</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matched-data"></a>
</h4>
<p>This is the function that conducts the matches. It primarily uses
<code>match_on()</code> function in the <code>optmatch</code> package to
generate a <span class="math inline">\(n x p\)</span> matrix of matches
for the chosen method, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is
the number of control units and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is the number of treated units. The output is then used to generate the
actual matches along with a number of other outputs that allow further
exploration of the data outside of the app if desired. However, it
should be noted that this function is not designed for complex matching
and may not be suitable for use with categorical data, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="matching-plot">
<code>matching.plot()</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matching-plot"></a>
</h4>
<p>This function takes the output from the <code>matched.data</code>
function and turns it into a <code>plotly</code> plot which shows an
accumulative matching of the treated and control units. Outside the app,
this plot can be generated on its own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="combined-plot">
<code>combined.plot()</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#combined-plot"></a>
</h4>
<p>The <code>combined.plot</code> function takes 2 different matching
methods generated by the <code>matched.data</code> function and returns
4 subplots that highlight the differences between the matching methods.
Plots 1 and 2 contain visualisations of the way the data has been
matched, Plot 3 shows the standardised mean differences between the
specified covariates and methods (specified in the function, not the
formula), and Plot 4 shows the differences in caclulated estimate of the
treatment effect for both methods. Plots 3 and 4 show the results for
each set of matched data as shown in Plots 1 and 2 as a progression
through the matching process with fixed values of the unadjusted data.
Plot 4 also includes stratified and weighted propensity score estimates
for comparison.</p>

<p>The development process for this app has meant that it has been most
practical to manage on GitHub. All the associated files and
documentation are hosted on a public GitHub repository -
<a href="https://github.com/jmeyer2482/WhatsMatching" target="_blank" class="external-link">https://github.com/jmeyer2482/WhatsMatching</a>.
In terms of the process undertaken, the <code>WhatsMatching</code>
package is the vehicle for the Shiny App as suggested in Golem
framework. From there, the <code>pkgdown</code> package has been used to
create a package based
<a href="https://jmeyer2482.github.io/WhatsMatching/" target="_blank" class="external-link">website</a>
which can also be deployed from GitHub.</p>
<p>The end result result of this developmental process means that there
is a Shiny App and Package Website that can be used in an educational
format. The GitHub hosting means that the package can be installed by
running
<code>devtools::install_github("jmeyer2482/Whatsmatching")</code> in an
<code>R</code> environment making the functions available to more
advanced users.</p>

<p>Here, we provide some examples that highlight the difficulties in
making decisions about how the matching process should occur.</p>

<p>This example uses one of the simulations from King and Neilsen’s 2019
paper. It takes three groups representing a fully blocked experiment, a
random experiment and a group of all controls. Covariates X1 and X2 are
generated with the fully blocked experiment being almost identically
paired between treated and control units and the random experiment group
has, as you would guess, randomly placed treated and control units. The
control group consists of only control units and no treated units.</p>
<p>The methods being compared in this example are the use of the
Mahalanobis distance, which is calculated using the distance between a
treated and control unit in the context of the covariance matrix, and
the Propensity Score, which is essentially logistic regression on the
treatment variable using selected covariates. The outcome demonstrated
is that, under these conditions, the Mahalanobis distance is superior to
the Propensity score in selecting the fully blocked experiment first.
This occurs because the Propensity score, once calculated, is blind to
the real data that informs the probability of treatment.<br>
Settings: Data from Simulation 1<br>
Method 1 - Mahalanobis ordered by data without replacement Method 2 -
Propensity score ordered by data without replacement Matched on
<code>X1</code> and <code>X2</code> Treatment effect calculated using
<code>y ~ t</code></p>

<p>Take home message:<br>
The propensity score may not be the best choice for achieving covariate
balance, which is a primary aim of matching.</p>

</h3>
<p>We demonstrate in Fig. 3. that the intuitiveness behind using
replacement may not be clear. This simulation is also from the King ans
Neilsen paper. <code>X1</code> and <code>X2</code> constitute 2
overlapping uniform distributions for the treated and control groups.
There are 200 units in the dataset with 100 units in each group. For
this simulation we have only changed whether the matches are conducted
with replacement.</p>
<p>You can clearly see that there are a number of the control units that
are unmatched. This has occurred because there are other “closer”
controls who can be matched to the treated units. If we look at <em>Plot
3</em> in the panel we can see that the covariate balance has been
maintained and, as we expect, the estimate treatment effect approaches
the true effect.</p>
<p>Settings: Data from Simulation 2<br>

<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Take home message:<br>
Datasets where the treated and control groups are approximately equal
may require the consideration of different settings to achieve covariate
balance and thus a more accurate estimate of the treatment effect.</p>
</div>

</h3>
<p>For this example we are using the same simulation as in Fig. 2. This
time we are comparing the ordering of the matches. In this case
comparison is starting with the smallest propensity score versus
starting with the largest. This essentially boils down to matching the
treated units with the lowest probability of being treated first or
starting with those with the highest probability of being treated.</p>
<p>We can see below in Fig. 4. that <em>Plot 1</em> has made some
unusual pairings. This makes some sense as when you pair units that have
the highest probability of being treated first then you quickly increase
the distances between the remaining units that need to be paired. This
means that the “good matches” are getting further and further away.</p>
<p>This is a problem that can occur for any matching method as most
matching methods use nearest neighbour methodology. If the best nearest
neighbour is already paired then the process just moves to the next
available one no matter the distance. This further highlights the
advantage of using replacement which conveniently ignores ordering and
selects the nearest partner irrespective of if it is matched.</p>
<p>Settings: Data from Simulation 1<br>

Method 2 - Propensity score ordered by smallest without
replacement<br>

<p>Take home message:<br>
The ordering or optimisation method of how the matches are selected can
impact what data is selected for analysis.</p>

</h3>
<p>Covariate specification and model selection are important when
undertaking matching. Ideally, the matching occurs in such a way that
the model specification is less important (another problem for causal
inference in observational data!) which will remove some of the bias. In
this simulation we have a bivariate normal distribution that has been
adjusted based on the user selections. The data generation here allows
users to select the treatment effect and how <code>X1</code> and
<code>X2</code> fit into the data from a causal aspect. In this case,
<code>X1</code> is a confounder between <code>t</code> and
<code>y</code>, and <code>X2</code> is a mediator between <code>t</code>
and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>There are a few things to unpick here. Firstly, we have only matched
on the confounding variable, <code>X1</code>, and we have included in
the model for the estimate. Interestingly, there is little difference
between the the 2 methods for matching, and therefore the covarate
balance and estimates are very similar. We can tell the pairing is
baised to <code>X1</code> because the lines the demonstrate the pairs
are vertical. That tells us the shortest distance between the units is
horizontal (aka the x-axis or <code>X1</code>).</p>
