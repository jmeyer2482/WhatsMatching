</h3>
<p>Estimating the causal effect of a treatment or intervention is a core
task of health data science. Randomised control trials (RCTs) are the
gold standard study design for estimating treatment effects, but in many
contexts RCTs are not feasible, for logistic or ethical reasons. As a
result, researchers often turn to observational data to address causal
research aims. These data are not ideal because there is no control over
who receives the treatment or exposure of interest and who does not,
introducing potential selection and confounding biases. Nonetheless,
observational data are a useful asset, being relatively cheap and easy
to access, and for exposures that cannot ethically be manipulated, they
offer the only possibility of investigating research questions of
interest.</p>

data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#approaches-to-obtaining-valid-causal-inferences-from-observational-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>It is still possible to obtain valid estimates of causal effects from
observational data, provided the limitations of the data are addressed
in the analysis. Many methodological approaches to address confounding
bias have been proposed over the years, including stratification,
regression adjustment, matching, applications of the propensity score
and g-computation methods. The primary aim of these methods is to reduce
bias in the estimation of the casual effect, especially confounding, by
balancing the distribution of confounding variables in the treated and
control groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="matching-methods">Matching methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matching-methods"></a>
</h3>
<p>Matching is a general pre-preproccessing technique used to improve
causal estimates from observational data by matching treated individuals
to untreated individuals with the same or similar background
characteristics. Matching results in a dataset where key background
characteristics are balanced in the treated and untreated groups. In an
RCT this balance is achieved through randomisation; the intuitive appeal
of matching is as a simple way to find an RCT “hidden” in an
observational dataset.</p>
<p>When there are a small number of matching variables and the pool of
potential matches is large it can be possible to match each treated
individual to a control with the exact same characteristics, leading to
a perfectly balanced dataset. However, this sort of exact matching is
often infeasible in practice, especially if there are numerous matching
variables and/or a small pool of potential matches.</p>
<p>One alternative to exact matching is coarsened exact matching. Under
this approach, matching variables are temporarily coarsened, for example
age measured in years might be recoded to 10-year age bands. The
coarsened variables are then used to undertake exact matching, and once
the balanced dataset is found the analysis can proceed with the original
uncoarsened data.</p>
<p>A second alternative to exact matching is distance-based matching.
Distance-based matching proceeds by matching treated and untreated
individuals based on some distance metric that quantifies the
similiarity between each pair of individuals in the dataset.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most widely used distance metric is the propensity score,
defined as the probability of an individual receiving the treatment.
Another possible distance metric is the Mahalanobis distance, which is
analogous to a multivariate Euclidean distance.</p>
<p>The advantage of both the propensity score and the Mahalanobis
distance metrics is that the multidimensional covariate space is reduced
to a single dimension: matching can be undertaken on the univariate
distance distance measure rather than attempting to match each
individual covariate. The covariates that define the distance metric are
balanced between the treated and untreated groups, on average, in the
resulting matched dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-propensity-score">The propensity score<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-propensity-score"></a>
</h3>
<p>Perhaps one of the most popular and enduring family of techniques for
estimating causal effects from observational data revolve around the
propensity score. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) defined the propensity
score as the “conditional probability of assignment to a particular
treatment given a vector of observed covariates”<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-rosenbaum1983central" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span>. Mathematically, this can be
expressed as <span class="math inline">\(e(x_i) = pr(Z_i=1|x)\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(e(x_i)\)</span> is the propensity
score, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the treatment variable,
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a vector of covariates, and
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> represents an individual.</p>
<p>In most cases, the propensity score is estimated from available data
using a simple logistic regression on a binary treatment assignment
indicator. The logistic regression formula looks like <span class="math inline">\(t \sim x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is a binary indicator of whether or not
the individual received the treatment and <span class="math inline">\(x_1 \ldots x_n\)</span> represent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observed covariates that help to
predict the treatment outcome. Although logistic regression is widely
used for this step, the estimation method is at the discretion of the
analyst and more flexible models can perform well [ref to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807890/" class="external-link uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807890/</a>]</p>
<p>Once estimated, the propensity score can be incorporated into the
data analysis in multiple ways. This includes matching (as alluded to
above), weighting and stratification (aka subclassification)2,4. All
three applications are briefly described below. Matching is the the
primary focus of the WhatsMatching app, however the app also allows
comparisons in estiamtes based on all three appraoches.</p>

stratification<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#applications-of-propensity-scores-matching-weighting-and-stratification"></a>
</h3>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="matching">Matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matching"></a>
</h4>
<p>A common application of the propensity score is as a distance metric
in distance-based matching. The distance between two individuals is
defined as the absolute difference in their propensity scores <span class="math inline">\(|e(x_1) - e(x_2)|\)</span>. Treated individuals
are matched to untreated individuals with similar propensity scores, and
in doing so the covariates that are used in the propensity score
estimation should be balanced on average in the treated and untreated
groups.</p>
<p>Many packages in <code>R</code> that perform matching analysis also
automate the process of estimating the propensity score. Once the
probabilities have been calculated then treated units are paired with
control units that have the same or similar probability of
treatment.</p>
<p>It is important to note that estimates should generally be based on
the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) when using matching
methods. This makes sense intuitively as matching effectively removes
individuals from the data that could not be considered both treated and
untreated. This is referred to as strongly ignorable treatment
assignment and is a key assumption for providing unbiased estimates with
the propensity score.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="weighting">Weighting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weighting"></a>
</h4>
<p>Weighting with the propensity score differs from matching as no units
are pruned from the dataset. This is an advantage over matching in the
sense that all data can remain in the analysis, giving the opportunity
to calculate the average treatment effect on all units (ATE), as opposed
to the ATT.</p>
<p>The formulas for weighting vary depending on the method you want to
employ. The data being analysed, by virtue of its source, may be more
appropriately analysed for the ATT and not the ATE. The formulas for
these weights are:<br><span class="math display">\[ATE,
w(W,x)=\frac{W}{\hat{e}(x)}+\frac{1-W}{1-\hat{e}(x)}\]</span><br><span class="math display">\[ATT,
w(W,x)=W+(1-W)\frac{\hat{e}(x)}{1-\hat{e}(x)}\]</span><br>
where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{e}(x)\)</span> indicates the
estimated propensity score conditional on observed <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> covariates1,3.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="stratification-aka-subclassification">Stratification (aka Subclassification)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stratification-aka-subclassification"></a>
</h4>
<p>The stratification method varies from matching and weighting in that
it relies on the use of the propensity score to group units into
quantiles. Once the number of groups has been established, the
literature suggests this is between five and ten depending on the size
of the dataset5, the treatment effect is estimated across the groups and
then averaged to give a mean difference ATE1,3.</p>

<h3 id="the-mahalanobis-distance">The Mahalanobis distance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-mahalanobis-distance"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Mahalanobis Distance was developed by Prasanta Chandra
Mahalanobis in 1936 as a means of comparing skulls based on their
measurements. It’s normal application calculates how many standard
deviations a point is from the mean of the specified variables and can
give a good indication of outliers in a group. In matching, the
application is similar but not quite the same. Instead of using the mean
as a comparator, each treated unit is compared, pairwise, with each of
the units in the control group.</p>
<p>The pairwise Mahalanobis Distance is calculated by <span class="math inline">\(D_{ij} = (X_i−X_j)W^{−1}(X_i−X_j)^T\)</span> (<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65705/pairwise-mahalanobis-distances" class="external-link uri">https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65705/pairwise-mahalanobis-distances</a>)
<strong>MH Try reference an academic source and avoid

and <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> represent the matrix of
covariates for the treated and control groups and <span class="math inline">\(W^{-1}\)</span> is the covariance matrix. Similar
to the Propensity Score, the Mahalanobis Distance reduces a
multidimensional space to a single value representing the distance
between units. A major difference, which will soon be seen, is how the
matches occur between the methods. The Mahalanobis Distance uses the raw
information to calculate the distance between individual units which is
in contrast to the Propensity Score which uses the probability of being
treated to then determine the distance.</p>

<p>MH I think this section should be where you summarise all of the
options that the analyst has to decide: matching algotihm, calipers,
ratio, sorting, replacement. I have cut and copied in some snippets of
text realted to this from above, needs to be tidied up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process and underlying logic of the matching process belies it’s
complexity. The propensity score matching process appears to be straight
forward and require little effort to implement, which is reflected in
its ubiquitous use. However, as King and Neilsen point out, there are
many situations where the use of the propensity score for matching may
not be suitable. Their 2019 paper gives many insights into the use of
the propensity score and why other methods, like coarsened exact
matching or distance-based matching with the Mahalanobis distance, may
be better choices. While some of the explanations do make intuitive
sense it can be difficult to decipher the practical application and
implications of the advice.<br>
There are different choices of matching algorithm available. Nearest
neighbour matching matches each treated individual in turn to the
nearest available untreated individual, i.e. the person with the small
distance with the smallest distance, . The application of callipers can
be used to control matching units that are considered too far apart.
Matching can be performed with or without replacement and it should be
noted that the order of the dataset when passed to the matching
algorithm can play a significant role in how units are matched when
matching without replacement2.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-propensity-score-paradox">The propensity score paradox<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-propensity-score-paradox"></a>
</h3>
<p>King and Neilsen presented a paradox that arises when using the
propensity score for matching2. They were able to demonstrate that, when
compared to other matching distances like the Mahalanobis distance,
matching on the propensity score only approximated a randomised
experiment as opposed to a more efficient fully blocked experiment.</p>
<p>As the matching algorithm proceeds, unmatched observations are pruned
from the dataset. Initially, this reduces the imbalance between the
treated and untreated groups with corresponding improvements to the
estimated treatment effect. However, after a certain threshold is
reached, further pruning the dataset starts to result in more biased
estimates of the treatment effect. This is the PSM paradox.</p>
<p>The authors postulated that this made matching on the propensity
score inferior and were able to demonstrate this concept visually but
were unable to provide mathematical proofs of the implications for real
data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="model-dependence">Model Dependence<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-dependence"></a>
</h3>
<p>Another issue that can arise generally with causal inference, but
then also specifically with matching, is model dependence. This is
essentially where the model selection still plays a large role in
predicting the estimate of the treatment effect. This is a problem
because that probably means that matching has not fixed the issue of
confounding and now selection bias needs to be managed as well.</p>

<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

</blockquote>
<p>The flexibility and convenience of distance-based matching approaches
have led to numerous software implementations and widespread use across
several quantitative disciplines. This is perhaps especially true of
propensity score matching, a modern workhorse of causal inference.
However, as with any sufficiently advanced technology, the complexity of
distance-based matching can be lost on the end user. The many subjective
decisions can be absorbed into the blackbox of a software function of
package, with nicely matched datasets appearing, as if by magic, at the
other end.</p>
<p>The aim of this research is to explore some basic matching
methodology and provide an interactive and educational space for people
who want to better understand matching methods. I will crack open the
propensity score matching algorithm, allowing uses to visualise matching
algorithms as they dynamically unfold, and compare results under
different combinations of user settings.</p>
<p>The resulting space is provided as a publicly available interactive
Shiny App and supported by a website and R package stored on Github.
This will allow students to experiment with different matching methods
and more experienced users to simulate their own matching experiments in
the R environment.</p>

development of an educational tool where users can build an intuitive

generate data and visualise the matching process as it unfolds. Users
will also be able to compare the performance of matching, with different
degrees of pruning, to the weighting and stratification applications of
the propensity score that don’t involve pruning, and to matching
approaches using the alternative Mahalanobis distance.</p>
