:::notes
-   Hi everyone, My name is Jason Meyer\
-   I've spent the last year, part-time developing my project with my spervisor Dr Mark Hanly\
-   Today I'd like to spend some time telling you about it.
-   In this project we were interested in the methodological approach of matching.
-   This is a very popular approach but it is black box.
-   What I've done is crack open the matching algorithm so that people can see the guts of it and how it works.
-   I have implemented this in an app and today I will briefly show you the app and outline some of the lessons that can be learned from this tool.

## Background {.build .ch}

-   RCTs are the gold standard but often not feasible

-   EHRs and other data sources are now plentiful

::: notes
-   We'd do RCTs for everything if we could unfortunately that's not practical, feasible or ethical in many cases.\
-   Enter electronic data sources, which have exploded in recent history, particularly in the health care arena\
-   This provides us with lots of opportunity for using data to solve or observe things we may not be able to under normal circumstance\
-   It is not without challenges though. Observational data is not built for this purpose and so the analysis and conclusions need to be considered carefully\
:::

## Matching {.ch}

-   Matching is one popular approach for addressing challenges in observational data

:::notes
distances 
- propensity score
- mahalanobis
- euclidean
- exact
- coarsened exact

covariate selection
- selection/model bias/variance

replacement
- should we replace, what are the implications

ordering
- how can that change what's happening!?

calipers
- what is a useful caliper adjustment

## We wanted to provide an interactive environment for people to learn about matching {.ch}

# Demonstration time!

:::notes
explanation of plot panels

I have selected the clearest example to demonstrate the impact of several choices that could impact the outcome of the estimate
We have generated data based on a simulation from King and Neilsen's paper on the Propensity score para

Now I'm going to show you what's been done 

DEMO


:::

## How do we use it

-   Simulate data
-   Choose settings
-   Watch

## What questions can we answer
- examples of questions that can be posed


## Development Process
