An alternative is to match based on a distance metric that measures the proximity between observations in the multivariate space of X. The idea then is to use observations that are “close”, but not necessarily equal, as matches. A common approach is to use  
$$MD(Xi, Xj)=\sqrt{(Xi-Xj )'\sum{^{-1}}(Xi-Xj )}$$
as distance metric, where $\textstyle \sum$ is an appropriate scaling matrix.  
- Mahalanobis matching: $\textstyle \sum$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.  
- Euclidean matching: $\textstyle \sum$ is the identity matrix.  
- Mahalanobis matching is equivalent to Euclidean matching based on standardized and orthogonalized $X$.
