<p>An alternative is to match based on a distance metric that measures
the proximity between observations in the multivariate space of X. The
idea then is to use observations that are “close”, but not necessarily
equal, as matches. A common approach is to use<br />
<span class="math display">\[MD(Xi, Xj)=\sqrt{(Xi-Xj
)&#39;\sum{^{-1}}(Xi-Xj )}\]</span> as distance metric, where <span class="math inline">\(\textstyle \sum\)</span> is an appropriate scaling
matrix.<br />
- Mahalanobis matching: <span class="math inline">\(\textstyle
\sum\)</span> is the covariance matrix of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.<br />
- Euclidean matching: <span class="math inline">\(\textstyle
\sum\)</span> is the identity matrix.<br />
- Mahalanobis matching is equivalent to Euclidean matching based on
standardized and orthogonalized <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
