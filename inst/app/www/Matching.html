<p>Matching requires that a type of distance between units is
calculated. This distance is then used to pair or match units that are
close together while discarding or pruning those that are not. Once
pruning has occurred to the satisfaction of the analyst, the treatment
effect can be estimated on the pruned dataset. Many methods of matching
have been explored in the literature and while the propensity score is
perhaps the most used distance metric, other distance metrics are
available, including the Mahalanobis distance.</p>
<p>It is important to note that estimates should generally be based on
the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) when using matching
methods. This makes sense intuitively as matching effectively removes
individuals from the data that could not be considered both treated and
untreated. This is referred to as strongly ignorable treatment
assignment and is a key assumption for providing unbiased estimates with
the propensity score.</p>
<p>Propensity score matching is usually conducted using nearest
neighbour matching. The application of callipers can be used to control
matching units that are considered too far apart. Matching can be
performed with or without replacement and it should be noted that the
order of the dataset when passed to the matching algorithm can play a
significant role in how units are matched when matching without
replacement.</p>
