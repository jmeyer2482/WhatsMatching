<p>In 2019, King and Neilsen published a paper presenting a paradox that
arises when using the propensity score for matching2. They were able to
demonstrate that, when compared to other matching distances like the
Mahalanobis distance, matching on the propensity score only approximated
a randomised experiment as opposed to a more efficient fully blocked
experiment.</p>
<p>As the matching algorithm proceeds, unmatched observations are pruned
from the dataset. Initially, this reduces the imbalance between the
treated and untreated groups with corresponding improvements to the
estimated treatment effect. However, after a certain threshold is
reached, further pruning the dataset starts to result in more biased
estimates of the treatment effect. This is the PSM paradox.</p>
<p>The authors postulated that this made matching on the propensity
score inferior and were able to demonstrate this concept visually but
were unable to provide mathematical proofs of the implications.</p>
<p>The question arises, does this paradox occur in the two other
applications of the propensity score discussed above (weighting and
stratification)? A review of recent literature would suggest not.</p>
