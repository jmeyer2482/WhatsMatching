	abstract = {Propensity score analysis is often used to address selection bias in program evaluation with observational data. However, a recent study suggested that propensity score matching may accomplish the opposite of its intended goal—increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. We assess common propensity score models and offer our responses to these criticisms. We used Monte Carlo methods to simulate two alternative settings of data creation—selection on observed variables versus selection on unobserved variables—and compared eight propensity score models on bias reduction and sample-size retention. Based on the simulations, no single propensity score method reduced bias across all scenarios. Optimal results depend on the fit between assumptions embedded in the analytic model and the process of data generation. Methodologic knowledge of model assumptions and substantive knowledge of causal mechanisms, including sources of selection bias, should inform the choice of analytic strategies involving propensity scores.},

As with propensity scores, stratification on prognostic scores brings to uncontrolled studies a concrete and desirable form of balance, a balance that is more familiar as an objective of experimental control. Like propensity scores, prognostic scores can reduce the dimension of the covariate, yet causal inferences conditional on them are as valid as are inferences conditional only on the unreduced covariate. As a method of adjustment unto itself, prognostic scoring has limitations not shared with propensity scoring, but it holds promise as a complement to the propensity score, particularly in certain designs for which unassisted propensity adjustment is difficult or infeasible.},

abstract = {The printing press long ago and the computer today have made widespread access to information possible. Learning theorists have suggested, however, that mere information is a poor way to learn. Instead, more effective learning comes through doing. While the most popularized element of today's MOOCs are the video lectures, many MOOCs also include interactive activities that can afford learning by doing. This paper explores the learning benefits of the use of informational assets (e.g., videos and text) in MOOCs, versus the learning by doing opportunities that interactive activities provide. We find that students doing more activities learn more than students watching more videos or reading more pages. We estimate the learning benefit from extra doing (1 SD increase) to be more than six times that of extra watching or reading. Our data, from a psychology MOOC, is correlational in character, however we employ causal inference mechanisms to lend support for the claim that the associations we find are causal.},

	abstract = {We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal—thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

We review popular versions of these approaches and related methods offering improved precision, describe theoretical properties and highlight their implications for practice, and present extensive comparisons of performance that provide guidance for practical use.

	abstract = {Certain pitfalls associated with propensity score matching have come to light, recently. The extent to which these pitfalls might threaten validity and precision in pharmacoepidemiologic research, for which propensity score matching often is used, is uncertain. We evaluated the “propensity score matching paradox” – the tendency for covariate imbalance to increase in a propensity score-matched dataset upon continuous pruning of matched sets – as well as the utility of coarsened exact matching, a technique that has been posed as a preferable alternative to propensity score matching, especially in light of the “propensity score matching paradox”. We show that the “propensity score matching paradox” may not threaten causal inference that is based on propensity score matching in typical pharmacoepidemiologic settings to the extent predicted by previous research. Moreover, even though coarsened exact matching substantially improves covariate balance, it may not be optimal in typical pharmacoepidemiologic settings due to the extreme loss of study size (and resulting increase in bias and variance) that may be required to build the matched dataset. Finally, we explain variability in 1:1 propensity score matching without replacement as well as methods that were developed to account for this variability, with application of these methods to an example claims-based study.},

We evaluated the effect of this phenomenon using insurance claims data from the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (1999–2002) and Medicaid Analytic eXtract (2000–2007) databases in the United States. For each data set, we created several 1:1 propensity-score–matched data sets by manipulating the size of the covariate set used to generate propensity scores, the index exposure prevalence in the prematched data set, and the matching algorithm. We matched all index units, then progressively pruned matched sets in order of decreasing propensity score distance, calculating covariate imbalance after each pruning. Although covariate imbalance sometimes increased after progressive pruning of matched sets, the application of commonly used propensity score calipers for defining an acceptable match stopped pruning near the lowest region of the imbalance trend and resulted in an improvement over the imbalance in the prematched data set. Thus, propensity score matching does not appear to induce increased covariate imbalance when standard propensity score calipers are applied in these types of pharmacoepidemiologic studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The propensity score is the conditional probability of assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of observed covariates. Both large and small sample theory show that adjustment for the scalar propensity score is sufficient to remove bias due to all observed covariates. Applications include: (i) matched sampling on the univariate propensity score, which is a generalization of discriminant matching, (ii) multivariate adjustment by subclassification on the propensity score where the same subclasses are used to estimate treatment effects for all outcome variables and in all subpopulations, and (iii) visual representation of multivariate covariance adjustment by a two-dimensional plot.DEFINITIONSThe Structure of Studies for Causal EffectsInferences about the effects of treatments involve speculations about the effect one treatment would have had on a unit which, in fact, received some other treatment. We consider the case of two treatments, numbered 1 and 0. In principle, the ith of the N units under study has both a response r1i that would have resulted if it had received treatment 1, and a response r0i that would have resulted if it had received treatment 0. In this formulation, causal effects are comparisons of r1i and r0i, for example r1i – r0i or r1i/r0i. Since each unit receives only one treatment, either r1i or r0i is observed, but not both, so comparisons of r1i and r0i imply some degree of speculation.},

Its properties for statistical inference have also been investigated and well documented. However, some recent publications showed concern of using PSM, especially on increasing postmatching covariate imbalance, leading to discussion on whether PSM should be used or not. We review empirical and theoretical evidence for and against its use in practice and revisit the property of equal percent bias reduction and adapt it to more practical situations, showing that PSM has some additional desirable properties. With a small simulation, we explore the impact of caliper width on biases due to mismatching in matched samples and due to the difference between matched and target populations and show some issue of PSM may be due to inadequate caliper selection. In summary, we argue that the right question should be when and how to use PSM rather than to use or not to use it and give suggestions accordingly.},
