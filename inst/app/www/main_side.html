<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This app uses some basic matching principles to provide insights into
matching methodology for educational purposes. The plots to the left
demonstrate how matching methods work in practice. Generally, matching
is used to assist in controlling confounding and bias in observational
data prior to estimating the treatment effect. In most cases the
treatment variable that is used for matching is binary, which is this
case for the data avaiable in this app.</p>
<p>The simulated data used to compare matching methods include a
treatment variable (<code>t</code>), covariates (<code>X1</code> and
<code>X2</code>) and an outcome variable (<code>y</code>).</p>

<h4>Plot 1 and Plot 2</h4>
<p>Plot 1 and 2 show the actual data the matches were performed on. A
frame by frame progression of how the matches occurred for two methods
specified by the user are shown. Blue triangles represent the treated
group, red triangles the control group. When matching occurs, every
treated unit is paired with a control.</p>

<h4>Plot 3 - Standardised Mean Difference (SMD)</h4>
<p>Plot 3 shows the SMD between each of the covariates for the raw
values and each of the matching methods. Each frame shows the changes in
the SMD for the matched data in Plot 1 and Plot 2. The raw SMD does not
change as the underlying data does not change.</p>

<h4>Plot 4 - Estimates of the Treatment Effect</h4>
<p>Plot 4 shows the estimates of the treatment effect for:<br />
- the unadjusted linear regression (Raw)<br />
- propensity score stratification<br />
- propensity score weighting<br />
- the two pre-specified matching methods<br />
- the actual treatment effect (only applicable in simulated data)</p>
<p>The cumulative effect of the estimates as units are added to the data
is also visible in relation to the matches seen in Plot 1 and 2. The
formula and the treatment effect used to simulate the outcome is the
same for all methods.</p>
