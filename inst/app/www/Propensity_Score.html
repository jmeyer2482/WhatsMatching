<p>The propensity score allows the reduction of a multidimensional space
to a single dimension for easy comparison between treated and untreated
units. Mathematically, it can be formulated as <span class="math inline">\(e(x_i) = pr(Z_i=1|x)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(e(x_i)\)</span> is the propensity score, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the treatment variable, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a vector of covariates, and <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> represents an individual. Therefore,
the propensity score is the probability of receiving treatment given
covariates <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.<br />
In observational data there is no ability to control which people
receive treatment and which do not. In fact, there is often little
control over the available covariates that may help inform the outcomes.
This potentially exposes observational data to selection bias and
confounding. The objective of using the propensity score in data
analysis is to replicate a randomised experiment within observational
data as a means of bias reduction and covariate balancing. The
propensity score can be used in multiple way to achieve this, notably
matching, weighting and stratification (aka subclassification).</p>
<div id="weighting" class="section level4">
<h4>Weighting</h4>
<p>Weighting with the propensity score differs from matching as no units
are pruned from the dataset. This is an advantage over matching in the
sense that all data can remain in the analysis, giving the opportunity
to calculate the average treatment effect on all units (ATE), as opposed
to the ATT.</p>
<p>The formulas for weighting vary depending on the method you want to
employ. The data being analysed, by virtue of its source, may be more
appropriately analysed for the ATT and not the ATE. The formulas for
these weights are:<br />
<span class="math display">\[ATE, w(W,x) =
\frac{W}{\hat{e}(x)}+\frac{1-W}{1-\hat{e}(x)}\]</span><br />
and<br />
<span class="math display">\[ATE, w(W,x) =
W+(1-W)\frac{\hat{e}(x)}{1-\hat{e}(x)}\]</span><br />
where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{e}(x)\)</span> indicates the
estimated propensity score conditional on observed x covariates.</p>
</div>
<div id="stratification" class="section level4">
<h4>Stratification</h4>
<p>The stratification method varies from matching and weighting in that
it relies on the use of the propensity score to group units into
quantiles. Once the number of groups has been established, the
literature suggests this is between five and ten depending on the size
of the dataset5, the treatment effect is estimated across the groups and
then averaged to give a mean difference ATE<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-guo_propensity_2020" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span>.</p>
